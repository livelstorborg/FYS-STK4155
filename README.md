## Course Overview
The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for studies of statistical data analysis and machine learning. The course is project-based and through the various projects, the students are exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state-of-the-art scientific results. The students will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities, and learn how to handle large scientific projects. Good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

### Project 1: Regression Analysis of Runge's Function
Comparing and implementing various regression methods to fit Runge's function, including OLS, Ridge, and Lasso regression, and different gradient descent methods to find optimal parameters to approximate the target data. Measuring performance using MSE and R2 score, and analyzing bias-variance trade-off.
